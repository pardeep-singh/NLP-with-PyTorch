# NLP-with-PyTorch

This repository contains the reference notes and code implementation from [Natural Language Processing with PyTorch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781491978221/) book. 

__Note: This repository is only for reference and shouldnt be used as book substitute. Go, buy and read the book if you are interested in learning how to use PyTorch to solve NLP problems. This is one of the most practical and useful books I have read on NLP.__

This respository contains the following:

- Book code and notes
- Example of applying the concepts learned in book to kaggle practice competition: [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)
